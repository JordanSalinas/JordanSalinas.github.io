  <p class="astro-AFJ6GZRA">Gozova is a moving company which provides a platform for movers and customers to connect. While there I worked to develop mobile and web applications written in React and React-native. I used typescript on the backend to write our RESTful api which used HapiJS for the server, JOI for payload/param validation, MongoDB, and Postgres. I also helped to move our website over to Wordpress and worked on implementing GA4 (Google analytics) into our apps while there. </p>

During my time there I developed 3 greenfield projects all in React as well as a mobile app in React Native. I worked to develop requirements, implement new features/designs, mentor devs, implement CICD, deploy code, and ensure code was high quality and tech debt was low. I researched and vetted open source libraries where they were needed for our apps, and developed new architecture/components to help us flesh out our web and mobile designs.</p>

  <p class="astro-AFJ6GZRA">Apex is a company which does freight factoring. They buy freight invoices from truckers at a discounted rate so that independent truckers can get paid more quickly and donâ€™t have to deal with collecting payment.

I worked with Java, SQL, and did some frontend work using JQuery.</p>

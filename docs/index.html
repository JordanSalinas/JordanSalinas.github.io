While there I worked to develop mobile and web applications written in React and React-native. I used typescript on the backend to write our RESTful api which used HapiJS for the server, JOI for payload/param validation, MongoDB, and Postgres. I also helped to move our website over to Wordpress and worked on implementing GA4 (Google analytics) into our apps while there. </p>

They develop apps which help companies educate their employees, clients, and users on relevant topics. During my time there I developed 3 greenfield projects all in React as well as a mobile app in React Native. I worked to develop requirements, implement new features/designs, mentor devs, implement CICD, deploy code, and ensure code was high quality and tech debt was low. I researched and vetted open source libraries where they were needed for our apps, and developed new architecture/components to help us flesh out our web and mobile designs.</p>

				<Experience src="/gozova-logo.png" dates="Oct 2022 - Dec 2022" description="Gozova is a moving company which provides a platform for movers and customers to connect. While there I worked to develop mobile and web applications written in React and React-native. I used typescript on the backend to write our RESTful api which used HapiJS for the server, JOI for payload/param validation, MongoDB, and Postgres.

				<Experience src="/trivie-logo.png" dates="Sep 2020 - Aug 2022" description="Trivie is a learning software company. They develop apps which help companies educate their employees, clients, and users on relevant topics. During my time there I developed 3 greenfield projects all in React as well as a mobile app in React Native. I worked to develop requirements, implement new features/designs, mentor devs, implement CICD, deploy code, and ensure code was high quality and tech debt was low. I researched and vetted open source libraries where they were needed for our apps, and developed new architecture/components to help us flesh out our web and mobile designs." />

				<Experience src="/dairy-com-logo.jpg" dates="Jan 2018 - Sep 2020" description="Dairy.com provides software to manage the logistics of dairy products. During my time there I designed and implemented applications in proprietary and open-source frameworks including React and Angular. I worked on a mobile app written in Ionic and Angular. I also handled code deployments and delivered a handful of applications from developing requirements to deploying in production. I wrote components, and helped guide both legacy and new projects." />

				<Experience src="/jp-morgan-chase-logo.png" dates="May 2017 - Nov 2017" description="I worked as a contractor for JPMorgan Chase for 6 months. In that time I wrote interfaces which modeled data, functions, and content required for the chase application.

I worked with Java, SQL, and did some frontend work using JQuery." />
